# 💰 Loan Approval Prediction

This is a Streamlit-based machine learning application that predicts the likelihood of a person getting loan approval. The model used is a **Random Forest Classifier**, trained on a historical credit dataset to predict whether a loan will be paid off or is at risk of default.

This project was developed as part of a Data Science & Machine Learning portfolio to demonstrate skills in data preprocessing, model building, and interactive application deployment.
